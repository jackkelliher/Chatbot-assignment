# in608-chat-server
# To set the server up, first run the database.py file at least once to create the relevant tables needed for operation
# No packages should be needed except for sqlalchemy, socket, struct, _thread
# Next run the server.py file and use the message_client to interact with the server.
# Make sure the database.py file is in the same directory as the server.py file as server.py relies on the presence of database.py to send and recieve data from the database
